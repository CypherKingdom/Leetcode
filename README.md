# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- Each problem solution is contained in a single file named `probX.cpp`, where X is the problem number
- Solutions include detailed problem descriptions, examples, and constraints
- Code is well-commented with explanations of the algorithms and approaches used

## Problems Solved

| # | Difficulty | Problem | Description | Solution |
|---|------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Easy | Two Sum | Find indices of two numbers that add up to target | [prob1.cpp](./prob1.cpp) |
| 2 | Medium | Add Two Numbers | Add two numbers represented as linked lists | [prob2.cpp](./prob2.cpp) |
| 3 | Medium | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters | [prob3.cpp](./prob3.cpp) |
| 4 | Hard | Median of Two Sorted Arrays | Find the median of two sorted arrays | [prob4.cpp](./prob4.cpp) |
| 5 | Medium | Longest Palindromic Substring | Find the longest palindromic substring | [prob5.cpp](./prob5.cpp) |
| 9 | Easy | Palindrome Number | Check if an integer is a palindrome | [prob9.cpp](./prob9.cpp) |
| 13 | Easy | Roman to Integer | Convert roman numerals to integer | [prob13.cpp](./prob13.cpp) |
| 88 | Easy | Merge Sorted Array | Merge two sorted arrays into one | [prob88.cpp](./prob88.cpp) |
| 632 | Hard | Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists | Find smallest range containing elements from k lists | [prob632.cpp](./prob632.cpp) |

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE

### Compilation and Execution
The repository is configured with VSCode tasks for building and running the solutions:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /path/to/Leetcode

# Compile a specific solution (using GCC)
g++ -g probX.cpp -o probX.exe

# Run the solution
./probX.exe
```

## Code Structure

Each solution file typically includes:
1. Problem description with examples and constraints as comments
2. Detailed explanation of the algorithm and approach
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. One or more solution implementations
